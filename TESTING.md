# Django Automated Testing 

### Terminal Command
```
python3 manage.py test app_name.test_filename --settings=silver_sands.test_settings -v3
```

This terminal command was used to run each of the test files within the Silver Sands Estate project individually. The file path to each of the test python files is specified in 'app_name.test_filename'. 
For example to run the automated test_models.py in the products app created to test the products models.py the following was executed in the terminal:
```
python3 manage.py test products.test_models --settings=silver_sands.test_settings -v3
```
All models, forms and views have been tested within each app using automated testing.

### Django unit testing
The Silver Sands project consist of 7 main apps. Within these apps are automated testing files designed to test the models, forms and views within each app. We can run each of these tests seperately. I was aware of the want and need to implement automated testing from the begining of the porject. I chose to first complete the development of all funcitonality first and run the automated testing at the end. The automated tests found a few bugs related to the form handling and submission of invalid form entries making it quick and easy to locate and fix the bugs. On reflecton I found this to be a good method however I would like to have, and will in the future implement and run automated testing along side development in order to increase productivity.

More duplicate tests could have been created using the automated Django method to ensure every required field was tested and all format and length validations considered. However I have only run these duplicate validation tests on a maximum of two fields using this method as I have manually tested all all field validations successfully. This includes required field, format and length validations.

## Validation
### HTML Validation

The project HTML templates have been thoroughly checked by validating each deployed page using the [W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/). To do this, I copied the deployed URL of each page directly from the browser's address bar. After obtaining the URL, I navigated to the W3C Validator, where I pasted the copied URL into the designated input field for validation. Once submitted, the validator checked the HTML structure of each page, ensuring compliance with web standards. This process confirmed that no warnings or errors were present in any of the HTML templates as shown in the reports below.

Although there were no error or warning messages displayed when after validating the html templates there was the occasional 'Info' tag that indicted the same 'trailing slash on void elements has no effect'. This comes from the Allauth templates and as a result of its passive nature has not been changed in the multiple templates it occurs in. See the 'Edit Product' report in the list below for reference.

No warnings or errors were found when passing the css through the [W3C (Jigsaw)](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_uri). I have manually run these checks by copying each of the deployed page URLs and pasting them into the validator.

### JS Validation

All javascript files were validated and no warning or error messages were found when passing the java script files through the [JSHint](https://www.jshint.com/) validator. However there were informational messages/notices indicating  useful insights into code that does not necesarily affect its functionality.

During the validation of JavaScript code using JSHint, a handfull of 'unused variable' messages were found. It is important to note that these variables correspond to functions invoked within the HTML templates, which were not included in the JSHint validation context. Consequently, JSHint is unable to recognize that these functions are actively utilized in the application's user interface. To confirm the use of these functions the corresponding html templates have been manually checked for the function invoking. 

To ensure JSHint correctly validated jQuery \$ functions within some of the javascript files, JSHint has been configured to recognise \$ as a global variable by adding,
```
/* jshint jquery: true */
/* global $ */
```
to the top of the javascript file being validated.

To ensure JSHint recognises the bootstrap variable (from the bootstrap library/framework) refered to in the manage_orders.js file a similar approach has been taken to configure JSHint it recognise bootstrap as a global variable by adding,
```
/* global bootstrap */
```
to the top of the javascript file being validated.

### Python Validation

No warnings or errors were found when the python code was passed through [Code institutes Python Linter validation tool](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/). According to the reports, the code is [Pep 8-compliant](https://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/). This checking was done manually by copying python code and pasting it into the validator. 

Pasting in each of the python files within the project ultimately rendered the same results/report. [Click here](documentation/testing/py_checks/py-checks-checkout-views.png) to see the results from pasting in the checkout apps views.py file, returning a result of 'All clear, no errors found'. As mentioned this same method and results were followed for all python files within the project including all views, forms and models.
